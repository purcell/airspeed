# Airspeed - a Python template engine

## What is Airspeed?

Airspeed is a powerful and easy-to-use templating engine for Python
that aims for a high level of compatibility with the popular
[Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html)
library for Java.

## Selling points

* Compatible with Velocity templates
* Compatible with Python 2.7 and greater, including Jython
* Features include macros definitions, conditionals, sub-templates and much more
* Airspeed is already being put to serious use
* Comprehensive set of unit tests; the entire library was written test-first
* Reasonably fast
* A single Python module of a few kilobytes, and not the 500kb of Velocity
* Liberal licence (BSD-style)

## Why another templating engine?

A number of excellent templating mechanisms already exist for Python,
including [Cheetah](http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/), which has a
syntax similar to Airspeed.

However, in making Airspeed's syntax *identical* to that of Velocity,
our goal is to allow Python programmers to prototype, replace or
extend Java code that relies on Velocity.

A simple example:

```python
t = airspeed.Template("""
Old people:
#foreach ($person in $people)
 #if($person.age > 70)
  $person.name
 #end
#end

Third person is $people[2].name
""")
people = [{'name': 'Bill', 'age': 100}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 90}, {'name': 'Mark', 'age': 25}]
print t.merge(locals())
```

You can also use "Loaders" to allow templates to include each other using the `#include` or `#parse` directives:

```
% cat /tmp/1.txt
Bingo!
% cat /tmp/2.txt
#parse ("2.txt")
% python
Python 2.4.4 (#1, May 28 2007, 00:47:43)
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5367)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from airspeed import CachingFileLoader
>>> loader = CachingFileLoader("/tmp")
>>> template = loader.load_template("1.txt")
>>> template.merge({}, loader=loader)
'Bingo!\n'
```

### How compatible is Airspeed with Velocity?

All Airspeed templates should work correctly with Velocity. The vast
majority of Velocity templates will work correctly with Airspeed.

### What does and doesn't work?

Airspeed currently implements a very significant subset of the
Velocity functionality, including `$variables`, the `#if`, `#foreach`,
`#macro`, `#include` and `#parse` directives, and `"$interpolated #strings()"`. Templates are unicode-safe.

The output of templates in Airspeed is not yet 'whitespace compatible'
with Velocity's rendering of the same templates, which generally does
not matter for web applications.

### Where do I get it?

### Getting started

The
[Velocity User Guide](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.7/user-guide.html)
shows how to write templates.  Our unit tests show how to use the
templates from your code.

### Reporting bugs

Please feel free to create tickets for bugs or desired features.

### Who is to blame?

Airspeed was conceived by Chris Tarttelin, and implemented jointly in
a test-driven manner by Steve Purcell and Chris Tarttelin. We can be
contacted by e-mail by using our first names (at) pythonconsulting dot
com.

Extensions for compatibility with Velocity 1.7 were kindly provided by
[Giannis Dzegoutanis](https://github.com/erasmospunk), and further modernization
has been done by [David Black](https://github.com/dbaxa/).
